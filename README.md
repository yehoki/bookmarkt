## Usage

- Create an account and login using either email & password credentials or using your Github or Google account.
- Search for books in which you are interested in, using the Google Books API and save them to your bookshelves.
- Write book reviews and rate books; see what other users have rated them as well as the current average rating.
- Add friends and other users, and see what their thoughts are on the books.
- Combinining the best of both worlds - optimised and matched together mobile and desktop versions of the web application, using CSS media breakpoints to get you the best experience no matter what device.

## Architecture

Bookmarkt is a modern full stack application, using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework.

### Frontend

- The main part of the frontend is developed using Typescript for type safety, alongside the React library.
- Zustand for state management.
- TailwindCSS for styling, as well as simple responsive design with media queries.

#### Frontend routes

The frontend has multiple specific routes, closely resembling that to that of Goodreads'.

- `/` The home page displays recent book updates from users using the app.

- `/books/[bookId]` Displays individual book

- `/books/user/[userId]` Displays all of the user's books, which can be

- `/friend` Displays the list of friends of the currently logged in user.

- `/friend/[userId]` Displays the list of friends of the user corresponding to the userId.

- `/login` Credentials login page.

- `/register` Credentials registration page.

- `/search?q=[query]` Displays books resulting from your search query.

- `/user/show/[userId]` Displays the user profile of the user corresponding to userId.

- `/user/sign_in` Displays the options for logging in using Google and Github authentication or with credentials.

- `/user/sign_up` - Displays the options for creating an account using Google and Github authentication or with credentials.

### Backend

- All of the backend is powered using Next.js API design with the app router.
- Next-auth has been used for user Authentication.
- Using the [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/using) for fetching book information.

### Database

- A combination of Prisma as an ORM, combined with MongoDB as a NoSQL database.

#### Database Design

Using MongoDB as the database with the following models:

- **Account**: Stores the account information when authenticated using Github or Google such as provider and token information.
- **BookData**: Used to keep track of total and average ratings for books, keeping track using their respective Google Books ID.
- **Bookshelf**: Contains bookshelf information, its respective books and the user to which it belongs.
- **Notification**: Stores notification information, such as who it's coming from, the type and time of the notification.
- **Review**: Holds reviews generated by the users, including the review description as well as the rating.
- **User**: Keeps track of user information, such as names, emails, hashed passwords and all IDs needed to keep track of all the remaining information like reviews, friends and books.
